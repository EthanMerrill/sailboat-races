We are a very friendly, diverse group of people who enjoy cruising and racing small to medium size sailboats on Lake Townsend. You do not need to own a boat to join the club or to go sailing with us.

On September 27, 1977 a few sailing enthusiasts met with city officials of the Parks and Recreation Department and Water and Sewer Department to present a proposal for formation of the Lake Townsend Yacht Club. The objective of the club is to promote sailing and to establish and maintain a club for athletic, recreational and social purposes. Through the continued cooperation and support of the city and club members, LTYC continues to be one of the most successful in the state. Races are held monthly throughout the year as well as a number of daysailing and cruising events.

The premier racing event of the year is the Mayors Cup Regatta which is held in June. There are usually forty or more boats entered by skippers from all over the state. Over the years, the club has sponsored a number of activities for nonmembers and the community in general - such as, sailing days for the Special Populations, open house and sailing seminars.",US Sailing Member,Yacht Club / Sailing Club,"Boat Ramp, On-Shore Boat Storage with Trailers, Restrooms","Handicap Accessible, Wheelchair Accessible Restroom",,"Adult, Youth",Small boats (dinghy),"Handicap - Portsmouth, PHRF, ORR, IRC, Multihull, One Design","Annual regattas, Frostbiting, Weekend series","['Class Description', ' Number In Class', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' Flying Scot', ' 10', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' Wayfarer', ' 6']","Racing (Dinghy), Small Boat Sailing (Dinghy), Small Multihull",http://www.laketownsendyachtclub.com,16,Greensboro,NC,27404,09867238,lake-townsend-yacht-club

The objective of the club is to promote sailing and to establish and maintain a club for athletic, recreational and social purposes. Through the continued cooperation and support of the city and club members, LTYC continues to be one of the most successful in the state. Races are held monthly throughout the year as well as a number of daysailing and cruising events.

The premier racing event of the year is the Mayors Cup Regatta which is held in June. There are usually forty or more boats entered by skippers from all over the state.

Our mission is to promote and sustain affordable educational, recreational and competitive sailing programs for all ages in a fun and safe environment. DC Sail empowers its participants to develop self-respect and sportsmanship, foster teamwork, and cultivate sailing skills and an appreciation for maritime-related activities. In addition, DC Sail enhances the DC community by using sailing to bolster community spirit and volunteerism.

Our active programs, located in both Southeast and Southwest Washington, D.C., are re-connecting people of the metropolitan region to the water. Sailing opportunities are available for adults and youth aboard small boats as well as our 65-foot schooner, American Spirit. Proceeds from our programs and year-around fundraising initiatives go toward offering under-served youth the opportunity to learn to sail through our Youth Scholarship Program.

DC Sail is the gateway to community sailing in Washington, DC!

We offer “Learn to Sail” programs for children, teens, and adults.

We operate out of two Marina locations: Small Boat Programs (lessons/youth programs) at our Diamond Teague Park Piers, 99 Potomac Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20003 and also The Wharf, where our 65-foot Schooner, ""American Spirit"" is docked: 600 Water Street SW, Washington, DC 20024.",US Sailing Member,Community Sailing Program,,,"Racing (Dinghy), Small Boat Sailing (Dinghy)","Adult, Youth",Small boats (dinghy),,"Frostbiting, Weekday series, Weekend series",[],,http://www.dcsail.org,15,SW Unit 9-16,SW,20024,09494347,dc-sail
